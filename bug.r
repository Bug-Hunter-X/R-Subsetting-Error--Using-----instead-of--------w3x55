```r
# This code attempts to subset a data frame using a character vector, 
# but it incorrectly uses `[` instead of `[[]]` to access columns by name.

data <- data.frame(a = 1:3, b = letters[1:3])
cols <- c("a", "b")

# Incorrect subsetting
subset1 <- data[cols]

# Correct subsetting
subset2 <- data[cols]

#This is wrong as subset1 will return a dataframe containing the first two rows whereas subset2 will return a dataframe with columns 'a' and 'b'.
